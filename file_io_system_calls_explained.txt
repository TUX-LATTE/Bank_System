## **1. Buffer**

* A **buffer** is simply a temporary storage area in memory.
* In file I/O, a buffer holds data **before** it’s read from or written to a file.
* Example:

  * When you use `read()`, data from the file is copied into a buffer in your program.
  * When you use `write()`, data from your program’s buffer is copied into kernel buffers before going to disk.

---

## **2. User Space**

* **User space** is the part of memory where your **application** runs.
* Programs here **cannot directly access hardware** — they must ask the kernel to do it.
* Safer: prevents buggy programs from crashing the whole system.

---

## **3. Kernel Space**

* **Kernel space** is the memory where the **operating system’s core** runs.
* It has **full access** to hardware and system resources.
* Only the kernel can directly communicate with devices like disks, networks, etc.
* Programs can only interact with kernel space through **system calls**.

---

## **4. User-Space Buffer**

* A **user-space buffer** is a block of memory in **your program** (user space) used to hold data temporarily.
* Example:

  ```c
  char buffer[100]; // This is a user-space buffer
  read(fd, buffer, 100);
  ```
* Here, `buffer` is in **your application’s memory**, and the kernel will copy data into it.

---

## **5. Kernel-Space Buffer**

* A **kernel-space buffer** is inside the operating system.
* The kernel uses it to temporarily store data coming from or going to hardware.
* Why?

  * Reading/writing directly to disk for every small piece of data would be very slow.
  * So, the kernel batches data in kernel buffers to improve speed.

---

## **6. Open File Table**

* When you open a file with `open()`, Linux creates an entry in the **system-wide open file table**.
* This table contains:

  * File position (offset)
  * Access mode (read/write)
  * Reference to the file’s **inode** or metadata
* Each process also has its own **per-process file descriptor table** pointing to these open file table entries.

---

## **7. File Structure**

* In the kernel, a **file structure** is a C struct (`struct file`) used to represent an open file.
* It stores:

  * Current position in the file
  * Flags (read-only, write-only, etc.)
  * Pointer to file operations (read, write functions)
  * Link to the file’s metadata (inode/FCB)

---

## **8. File Descriptor**

* A **file descriptor (FD)** is just an **integer** that your program uses to refer to an open file.

* Example:

  ```
  int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
  ```

  If `fd` is 3, then when you call:

  ```
  read(fd, buffer, size);
  ```

  the kernel knows exactly which file you mean by looking at your process’s file descriptor table.

* Standard FDs:

  * `0` = Standard Input (stdin)
  * `1` = Standard Output (stdout)
  * `2` = Standard Error (stderr)

---

## **9. FCB (File Control Block)**

* The **File Control Block** is a data structure on disk that stores metadata about the file:

  * File name
  * File size
  * Permissions
  * Timestamps
  * Disk block locations
* In Linux, this concept is implemented as the **inode**.

---

## **10. `0644` in the Code**

* `0644` is an **octal number** that sets file permissions when creating a new file (used in `open()` when `O_CREAT` is specified).
* Format: `0XYZ`

  * `X` = Owner permissions
  * `Y` = Group permissions
  * `Z` = Other users’ permissions
* Each digit is the sum of:

  * `4` → read
  * `2` → write
  * `1` → execute
* `0644` means:

  * Owner: `6` → read (4) + write (2) = read & write
  * Group: `4` → read only
  * Others: `4` → read only

If you want, I can **draw a diagram** showing how **user space buffers, kernel buffers, file descriptors, and the open file table** all connect when you do a `write()` in your C program.
It’ll make this much easier to visualize.

Do you want me to draw that for you?
